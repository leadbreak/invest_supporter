#Modeling

## Here are three models, each with two directions
## Each of the three models trains and predicts one, three, and twelve years' worth of data for the stock.
## Considering the high initial training rate, these three models were divided into two directions, forward and reverse, respectively, resulting in a total of six models.
## Through this, we have modeled three simple, medium, and long-term models that well reflect past trends and recent trends.

## The LSTM, GRU, and SimpleRNN algorithms were mixed and located according to the length of each period, and the internal parameters were adjusted.

## Each model was designed very conservatively and targeted at multiple targets and at least 3% or more profitable when targeted at the top 40% return.
